# flight-deals
Mini-project, created when going through the 100 Days of Code Python Course. The program has a list of cities some users want to visit and list of the users itself in Google Sheets. Using Sheety API and Tequila Flights API, this program searches suspiciously cheap flights to the following places and notifies users about them via email using smtp.
My parameters are set up so that the program looks for two-side flights for nearest 6 months, you can change it. Inside the "customer_acquisition" folder you can access the project files for customers' mini application, that allows them to sign up for notifications about cheap flights typing in their full name and email to be notified on.
Don't forget to set your own environmental variables. Enjoy using this app!
